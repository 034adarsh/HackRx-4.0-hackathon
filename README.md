  Welcome to the Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data project! This project focuses on extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it in a graph format. By visualizing stock data, individuals can make informed decisions based on the data. In this project, we will extract stock data and display it using Python libraries like yfinance, pandas, and plotly.
</p>

## Description

The project aims to extract stock data and revenue data from reliable sources. It utilizes the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data and the BeautifulSoup library to scrape revenue data from a webpage. The extracted data is then displayed in an interactive graph using the plotly library.

## Key Features

- Extraction of historical stock data using yfinance library
- Scraping revenue data from a webpage using BeautifulSoup library
- Visualization of stock data and revenue data in an interactive graph
- Customizable graph layout and styling options
